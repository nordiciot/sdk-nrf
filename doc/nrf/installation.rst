Installation
############

To start working with the |NCS|, :ref:`set up your development environment automatically using nRF Connect for Desktop <gs_assistant>`.
This will install all the :ref:`requirements <gs_recommended_versions>`, including the |VSC| and the `nRF Connect for Visual Studio Code`_ extension, which is recommended for building applications.

.. note::
   If you want to go through a dedicated training to familiarize yourself with the basic functionalities of the |NCS|, enroll in the `nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course`_ in the `Nordic Developer Academy`_.

If you have any issues when installing the |NCS| automatically, :ref:`install the nRF Connect SDK toolchain manually <gs_installing>`.
